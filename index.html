Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands.
Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer.
The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a “binary.” Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling.” Each language, from C Language to Python, has its own distinct features, though many times there are commonalities between programming languages.
and we need to know what a computer is, before we understand what programming is. A computer is a system capable of taking human instruction, processing it and reacting to it, or a computer is a computing device used by a computer program to process data. Program is an instruction series, together with data.
One computer's basic components are:
Input unit
Central Processing Unit(CPU)
Output unit
The CPU is further divided into three parts-
Memory unit
Control unit
Arithmetic Logic unit and Many of us have learned that CPU is called our computer's brain because it accepts data, provides temporary memory space for it before it is stored on the hard disk,
performs logical operations on it, and then transforms (including converting) data into information. We all know a machine is composed of hardware and software
Code is a series of programs that collectively perform multiple tasks. The operating system is also a program that lets humans communicate with the computer system.
A program is a series of instructions given to a machine to perform a particular operation. A computer is a computing system used to process data under computer program supervision.
Raw data is stored in the desired output format when running the program. Such computer programs are written in a language of programming which is of a high level High-level languages are almost human languages that are more complex than the computer-friendly language called machine language,
or low-level language. Therefore, after learning the fundamentals, we are prepared to build a very simple and straightforward system. Even as we have different languages to communicate with each other, so too we have different languages like C, C++, C#, Java, python, etc to communicate with the computers.
The computer only understands binary language (the language of 0’s and 1’s) also called machine-understandable language or low-level language but the programs we are going to write are in a high-level language which is almost similar to human language.
