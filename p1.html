If we talking about programming languages we will collide with "python language" where Python is a high level programming tool,
which means that it is easy to use and read, even as a beginner. The
philosophy behind the code is readability and it has a type of syntax that allows the
programmer to express their concepts without having pages of code along
with it. Compared to using other          can make popular codes, like Java and C++, this
Python much easier to complete.
The philosophy of this code language is simple enough to use. It believes
that a simple design is so much better than a complex one and that readability is
important. This is a great language for beginners to get started on because
they will actually be able to read and understand the code they are putting
in. With other options, they may have to spend a lot of time trying to get the
code just right, adding in many other symbols to get it to work. But with
Python, it is kept much simpler and you may find that it is easier to read through the lines and
see what you are doing.and some of another its futures is that An elegant syntax which will make the programs so easy to read.
and Language that is easy to use so that the program will work without a
lot of bugs. If you are doing ad hoc programming tasks or prototype
development because it works well without issues with maintaining the
program.
and Has a large library that will work with other programming tasks such as
changing files, searching for text, and connecting with web servers., presently we can examine sorts of programming language, for example, 

 JavaScript
  JavaScript: is a client side programming language that runs inside a client browser and processes commands on a computer rather than a server. It is commonly placed into an HTML or ASP file. Despite its name, JavaScript is not related to Java.
And which have use JavaScript is                           ‚ÄèJavaScript developers, Web developers and software engineers
Used by employers in information technology, Engineering, Design, Marketing, Finance and Healthcare and  Website Development, Gaming Development and its benefits is that Basic features are easy to learn
And Multiple frameworks
And people that use tnis can reference JQuery, a comprehensive Javascript library and its importance lies in JavaScript is used primarily in Web development to manipulate various page elements and make them more dynamic,
including scrolling abilities, printing the time and date, creating a calendar and other tasks not possible through plain HTML. It can also be used to create games and APIs. For example The agency Cyber-Duck in Britain uses public APIs,
created with JavaScript, to pull in data about crime and enables users to review a local are
for example The agency Cyber-Duck in Britain uses public APIs, created with JavaScript, to pull in data about crime and enables users to review a local area.
                          C language
C Language is a structure-oriented, middle-level programming language mostly used to develop low-level applications.and it's benefits lie in that
C Language is used to develop systems applications that are integrated into operating systems such as Windows, UNIX and Linux, as well as embedded softwares.
Applications include graphics packages, word processors, spreadsheets, operating system development, database systems, compilers and assemblers, network drivers and interpreters.
and people which have use it is Software developers, computer engineers, business and systems analysts, IT and Web content administrators, embedded software engineers
and Used by employers in Information        Technology, Engineering, Management,         
Healthcare and Professional Services
as well as benefits which is Simple to learn.and  there are only 32 keywords to master
and Easy to write systems programs such as compilers and interpreters
Foundational language for beginners.
Pronounced C-sharp (not C-hashtag), C# is a multi-paradigm programming language that features strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented and component-oriented disciplines.
and its importance is that C# helps developers create XML web services and Microsoft .NET-connected applications for Windows operating systems and the internet.for example
Used to develop a wide range of software applications that accompany Visual Studio IDE.and its advantages is Similar to Java in capabilities
and Ideal for beginners
and The go-to for working on Microsoft apps and people which have use it are C# developers, automation test engineers, software engineers, senior .net Web developers and Used by employers in Information Technology, Engineering, Design, Professional Services, Management and Quality
